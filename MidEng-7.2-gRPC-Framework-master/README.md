# Introduction

This exercise is intended to demonstrate the functionality and implementation of Remote Procedure Call (RPC) technology using the Open Source High Performance gRPC Framework **gRPC Frameworks** ([https://grpc.io](https://grpc.io/)). It shows that this framework can be used to develop a middleware system for connecting several services developed with different programming languages.

Document all individual implementation steps and any problems that arise in a log (Markdown). Create a GITHUB repository for this project and add the link to it in the comments.

# Dependencies

First, it is crucial to implement all the necessary dependencies. Without them, the program will not execute properly.

```jsx
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.grpc:grpc-netty:1.68.1'
    implementation 'io.grpc:grpc-protobuf:1.68.1'
    implementation 'io.grpc:grpc-stub:1.68.1'
    implementation 'io.grpc:grpc-api:1.68.1'
    compileOnly 'javax.annotation:javax.annotation-api:1.3.2'

    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-xml:2.18.1'
    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.18.1'
    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-core:2.18.1'
    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-annotations:2.18.1'
}
```

After we defined those dependencies in our `build.gradle` File we should run them so they get embeddet. Then we should bild the gradle.

# Proto Election

Afterward, I created the `.proto` file where I defined the structure and communication protocol for the gRPC service. Here’s what I implemented:

- **Service Definition**: I created the `ElectionService` with an RPC method called `transferElectionData`. This method takes an `ElectionDataRequest` as input and returns an `ElectionDataResponse`.
- **Message Structures**: I designed the following:
    - `ElectionDataRequest` to wrap the election data being sent.
    - `ElectionDataResponse` to contain a response message from the server.
    - `ElectionData` as the main structure to store regional information (e.g., region ID, name, address, and timestamp) along with a list of parties and their vote counts.
    - `Party` to represent individual party data with fields for `partyID` and `amountVotes`.

This file acts as the contract for the client-server communication, ensuring consistent data exchange.

# ElectionClient

Afterward, I created the `ElectionClient` class, which acts as the client in the gRPC communication. Here's what I implemented:

- **Connecting to the Server**:

  I initialized a `ManagedChannel` to establish a connection to the gRPC server running on a specific host and port.

- **Stub Creation**:

  I created a blocking stub using `ElectionServiceGrpc.newBlockingStub(channel)`, which allows the client to call the `transferElectionData` RPC method synchronously.

- **Data Preparation**:

  I wrote a method, `createElectionData`, to construct an instance of `ElectionData`. This includes setting the region details (e.g., ID, name, address) and adding a list of parties with their vote counts.

- **Sending Data**:

  I implemented the `sendElectionData` method, which:

    - Builds an `ElectionDataRequest` containing the prepared `ElectionData`.
    - Sends the request to the server via the stub.
    - Prints the server's response to confirm successful communication.

Then we need to define the Service in the `ElectionServiceImpl` Class.

And as the last step we should implement the service in our `MyServer` Class as follows

```jsx
public void start() throws IOException {
        server = ServerBuilder.forPort(PORT)
                .addService(new HelloWorldServiceImpl())     // Register HelloWorld service
                .addService(new ElectionServiceImpl())       // Register Election service
                .build()
                .start();

        System.out.println("Server started, listening on port " + PORT);
    }
```

# Questions & Answers

- What is gRPC and why does it work accross languages and platforms?
    - gRPC is a Remote Procedure Call framework developed by Google that enables communication between different applications and platforms in various programming languages. It works because it has a unified interface based on the open standard HTTP/2
- Describe the RPC life cycle starting with the RPC client?
    - The RPC client sends a request to the server's stub, the stub serializes the request, sends it to the server, the server processes the request, sends a response back, and the client stub deserializes the response.
- Describe the workflow of Protocol Buffers?
    - Define the message schema in a `.proto` file, compile it using `protoc` to generate code, use the generated code to serialize/deserialize data and transmit it.
- What are the benefits of using protocol buffers?
    - Efficient serialization (compact and fast).
    - Cross-platform compatibility.
    - Strongly typed schema for structured data.
- When is the use of protocol not recommended?
- List 3 different data types that can be used with protocol buffers?
    - `int32` (integer).
    - `string` (text).
    - `bool` (boolean).
